# Introduction

## Data Preprocessing Summary

### Data Collection

2. Performed social scraping for LinkedIn, X, and Instagram using search engines (Google)

### Data Cleaning and Formatting

3. Manually filled in missing data (NaN for startups with no social media presence)
4. Removed duplicates
5. Formatted the "industries" column to use the first listed industry as "Cleaned Industry"
6. Converted all dates to ISO format (using the first day of the month for missing days, and January for missing months)
7. Scraped historical EUR/USD data for currency exchange and formatted to ISO
8. Created a dummy variable for CEO LinkedIn connection count (>500 connections)
9. Converted all currencies to EUR using historical data
10. Added "Organization Age" (time between founded date and today, rounded to full years)
11. Split "Headquarters Location" into "Headquarters City" and "Headquarters State"
12. Added "funding_time_months" (last_funding_date â€“ founded_date, truncated to non-negative values)
13. Renamed columns for better handling
14. Coded funding rounds: Pre-Seed as 1, Seed as 2, and Series A as 3

### Feature Engineering

15. Added dummy variables for location and industry
16. Grouped "Cleaned Industry" into broader categories using GICS
17. Added dummy variables for the new industry groupings

### Data Transformation

18. Checked for skewness
19. Applied log transformation to highly skewed data, adding a small epsilon to avoid log(0)
20. Filled 0 for all empty entries (assuming startups with no funding are out of business)

This preprocessing pipeline ensures a clean, structured dataset ready for analysis, with appropriate handling of missing values, categorical variables, and skewed distributions.
